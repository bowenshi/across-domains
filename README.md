1. The data set and codes come from our paper titled "Domain-Relevance of Influence: Characterizing variations in online influence across multiple domains on social media".

2. Due to privacy consideration regarding users in our dataset, we have deleted the user names and IDs, and all target users have posted at least twice.

3. The eight files correspond to society, international, sports, technology, entertainment, finance, military and all domains respectively. The six attributes correspond to elite label, verified type, gender, number of followers, frequency of tweeting and in-degree value. Note that the values of verified type ranging from -1 to 3 refer to ordinary, celebrity , government, enterprise and media.
